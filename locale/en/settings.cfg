[mod-setting-description]
stack-combinator-debug-mode=Debug mode enables more detailed logging of actions the mod performs. During gameplay, debug messages are printed to in-game console and to a file in `script-output` folder. During startup, they're logged to the main game log.
stack-combinator-defaults-invert=Choose which wire's input signals invert by default on newly placed combinators. See the mod's full description for more information on signal inversion.
stack-combinator-signal-capacity=Maximum number of signals that a stack combinator can output. Higher values may* affect performance with large numbers of stack combinators in use.\n\n* Untested.
stack-combinator-require-power=Should the stack combinator require electricity to work?
stack-combinator-update-delay=How many ticks to wait between updates (reading incoming signals and calculating outputs). Increase this if you use a lot of StaCos and it's impacting performance, but be aware that the longer the delay, the longer outdated signals remain on the circuit network.
