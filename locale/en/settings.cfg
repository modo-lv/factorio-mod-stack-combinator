[mod-setting-description]
stack-combinator-debug-mode=Debug mode enables more detailed logging of actions the mod performs. During gameplay, debug messages are printed to in-game console and to a file in `script-output` folder. During startup, they're logged to the main game log.
stack-combinator-defaults-invert=Choose which wire's input signals invert by default on newly placed combinators. See the mod's full description for more information on signal inversion.
stack-combinator-signal-capacity=Maximum number of signals that a stack combinator can output. Higher values may* affect performance with large numbers of stack combinators in use.\n\n* Untested.
stack-combinator-require-power=Should the stack combinator require electricity to work?
stack-combinator-update-delay=How many ticks to wait between updates (reading incoming signals and calculating outputs). Increase this if you use a lot of StaCos and it's impacting performance, but be aware that the longer the delay, the longer outdated signals remain on the circuit network. 60 ticks (maximum) equals 1 second.
stack-combinator-update-limit=How many StaCos to process in a single update. Use this setting together with update delay to control how quickly combinator signals get updated. More combinators per update means more consistent and responsive signals, but at the cost of game performance.
